# Java Control Structures

## üìò Description

The Java Control Structures repository is designed to provide developers with a solid understanding of control flow mechanisms in Java. This repository explores essential concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and advanced control techniques to write logical and structured Java programs. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your skills, this repository contains comprehensive examples, detailed explanations, and practical exercises to help you master control structures in Java.

Key topics covered:

- Conditional Statements: Implementing decision-making logic using if, if-else, if-else-if, and switch.
- Loops: Iterating over data and executing code multiple times using for, while, and do-while.
- Advanced Control Mechanisms: Understanding break, continue, and labeled statements for complex control flow.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized in a way that allows for easy navigation, each section focusing on specific aspects of Java. Here is a breakdown of the file and folder structure:

### **Main Files**

### **src/**

This folder contains the source code, organized into examples and exercises:

Here are the descriptions in English:

- **Break.java**: Demonstrates the use of the break statement to exit loops prematurely.  
- **BreakRotulado.java**: Explores labeled break statements for advanced control flow in nested loops.  
- **Continue.java**: Highlights the continue statement for skipping iterations in a loop.  
- **ContinueRotulado.java**: Demonstrates labeled continue statements for advanced loop control.  
- **DesafioDiaSemana.java**: A challenge to implement logic based on user input representing days of the week.  
- **DesafioFor.java**: Exercises and challenges using the for loop.  
- **DesafioIf.java**: Exercises and challenges using conditional statements (if, if-else).  
- **DesafioWhile.java**: Challenges using while loops for repetitive logic.  
- **DoWhile.java**: Examples of the do-while loop, which ensures execution at least once before condition checking.  
- **For1.java, For2.java, For3.java**: Multiple examples demonstrating various for loop use cases.  
- **If.java, IfElse.java, IfElseIf.java**: Detailed examples of if, if-else, and if-else-if structures in Java.  
- **SwitchComBreak.java**: Shows the use of switch with break to control execution flow.  
- **SwitchSemBreak.java**: Demonstrates a switch statement without break, causing fall-through behavior.  
- **WhileDeterminado.java**: Explains using while loops with a predefined condition.  
- **WhileIndeterminado.java**: Demonstrates while loops where the number of iterations is unknown.
